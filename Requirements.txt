Stripe Integration
* Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table.
* JavaScript should prevent Pro form from submitting when user fills it out and 
    should send card info to stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
* JavaScript should send user fields and card token to our Rails app for validation. 
    Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token to 
    Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
    token. Rails should save customer token and user info to our database.

    current community view, but only I can access the URL.
