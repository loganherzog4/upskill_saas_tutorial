# README

This website is a fictional startup website intended to allow developers,
entrepreneurs, and investors to network.



I utilized the following tutorial to create the majority of website: 
[Upskill](http://upskillcourses.com) Software-as-a-Service Ruby on Rails App



This website was created using HTML5, CSS/Sass, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails as
a web dev learning experience.



Login authentication is handled through Devise, and I have no access to passwords.
E-commerce is handled through Stripe, and signing up for the "Pro" plan will not 
actually charge you, and you can enter fake details such as 4111-1111-1111-1111 
for card number and 123 for CVV in order to view the "Pro" versions of the website.


The website is hosted at the following URL: https://www.devmatchproject.com/


I hope you enjoy, and please send any bug reports via the "Contact Us" form on
the website, or by simply emailing me at: logan.herzog@gmail.com
